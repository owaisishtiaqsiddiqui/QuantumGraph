# QuantumGraph

This package helps you to make quantum algorithms based on the manipulation of a two-qubit tomography of a multi qubit device.

To get a better idea of what this means, and see how it works, see [the tutorial](Tutorial.ipynb).

Please go through [QuantumGraph.py](https://github.com/owaisishtiaqsiddiqui/QuantumGraph/blob/main/quantumgraph/QuantumGraph.py)
